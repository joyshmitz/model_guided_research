Matrix Exponential Gauge Block (PyTorch)
Implements Gauge Equivariant Layers using Lie Groups.
Simulates "Matrix Exponential Gauge Learning" via cumulative orthogonal transports.

Mathematical core (from JAX reference):
  - Transport: T_j = prod_{l<j} exp(A_l), with A_l skew-symmetric.
  - Implemented as cumulative product of rotations (or sum of angles for U(1)).
  - Gauge invariance: compare q_i with k_j transported by R_{i<-j} = T_i T_j^{-1}.
  - R_{i<-j} acts on features to align frames.

Block structure (bead model_guided_research-1fr6): the gauge block REPLACES the
whole transformer block (the A1 boundary decision from 7b0.1), but it carries
the canonical pre-norm residual skeleton inside itself:

    x = x + gauge_attention(norm(x))      # transport-wrapped attention
    x = x + mlp(norm(x))                  # standard MLP slot (passed in by Block)

Without the residuals, the repo's zero-init convention (c_proj and lm_head
start at zero) made the whole network output exactly zero and the gradients
mutually annihilate (total grad = 0.0) - gauge training was frozen at ln(V).
The residual restores the each-block-starts-as-identity property the zero
init is designed around. The MLP slot is passed in (mirroring the reversible
block's F/G modules) so _build_ffn dispatch - including the tropical FFN -
applies to gauge like every other block.

KV-cache decode (bead model_guided_research-7b0.5): the obstacle is the
cumulative gauge field - token t's global frame is the cumsum of all previous
local angles. The KVCache carries a per-layer fp32 running-cumsum lane
(engine.py, following the simplicial y1 precedent). Correctness crux, the
frame-invariance argument: keys and values are computed from the GLOBALLY
transported representation x_global_t = R(cumsum_t) @ norm(x_t) and inserted
into the cache already in the global frame. The global frame is fixed once
(frame of token 0), so a cached key never needs re-transporting when later
queries arrive: at decode step t we reconstruct exactly the same cumsum_t
(tracked in fp32 across steps so bf16 drift cannot accumulate), transport the
new token into the same global frame, and attend against cached keys as-is.
The output is pulled back to the local frame with the CURRENT token's angles,
which are available at decode time without any history.
