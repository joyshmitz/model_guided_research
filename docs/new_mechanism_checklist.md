# New-Mechanism Merge Gate (Checklist)

**Every new attention mechanism (an F-series implementation, e.g. mnn.2/3/5/6)
passes this gate before it is believed.** The gate is the cheap correctness
machinery that catches what benchmarks miss — and it has already paid off:
the `mnn.4` hyperbolic design's c→0 reduction was *wrong as written* (raw
distances reduce to a Laplacian kernel, not dot-product attention), and the
reduction-test reasoning is exactly what exposed it before a line of the
mechanism was implemented (see `gromov_product_and_the_ultrametric_hyperbolic_bridge.md` §3).

A mechanism that ships without these is a mechanism whose benchmark numbers you
cannot trust, because you have no independent check that it computes what it
claims. Order matters: items 1–4 are *design-time* (do them before writing the
torch module), 5–8 are *implementation-time*, 9 is *campaign-time* (and lives
in `campaign_preregistration_template.md`).

## The gate

### 1. Exact reduction to a known mechanism — as a `mgr certify` check (the keystone)

If the mechanism generalizes an existing one, there is a parameter regime where
it must reproduce that one **exactly** (to fp32 tolerance). Derive it, validate
it numerically *before writing the design*, and ship it as a certify check
under the new mechanism's name.

- Clifford restricted to the even subalgebra of Cl(3,0) == quaternion
  (`mnn.1` §3; the basis convention i=e₂₃, j=−e₁₃, k=−e₁₂ verified against the
  *implemented* `qmul` — a wrong guess fails silently, which is the point).
- Hyperbolic at c→0 == standard attention — **but only the energy-form score**;
  the raw-distance score reduces to a distance kernel (`8gk.6` §3, the caught
  bug). The reduction test *is* the spec: it tells you which score form is
  correct.
- Hyperbolic rescaled c→∞ == ultrametric LCP attention (`8gk.6` §4).

If the mechanism is genuinely novel (no sub-mechanism), substitute an **exact
hand-computable special case** (e.g. tropical's β→∞ == hard-max with the
LSE–max sandwich; ultrametric hard-digit == exact trie decode). The principle
is the same: one input regime where the answer is known by other means.

### 2. Structure-free placebo control (design the prediction now)

If the mechanism claims to exploit a structure (hierarchy, brackets,
composition, scale), its registry prediction must come with a placebo arm on
structure-free data at equal budget. "Wins on placebo too" ⇒ the win is not
about that structure. The mechanism's interpretability observable (item 6)
should *collapse to trivial* on placebo (e.g. hyperbolic curvature → 0); that
collapse is the honest null and is welcomed. (Campaign wiring: §6 of the
pre-registration template.)

### 3. Parameterization coordinate-check (`lab.1`)

Before any matched-FLOPs comparison across widths, verify the mechanism's
init/LR scaling with a coordinate check (activation- and update-scale flat in
log-width). Non-CLT mechanisms (tropical/max-plus are extreme-value/Gumbel
class, not Gaussian-sum) need different scalings than muP assumes; "X beats Y
at matched FLOPs" can otherwise just mean "Y is mis-scaled at this width."
This is the standing `lab.1` harness; a new mechanism registers its
concentration class and gets one coordinate-check row.

### 4. Validate every theory claim numerically before writing the design doc

Build the algebra/geometry from first principles in a scratch script, assert
the load-bearing identities, and put the receipts in the doc's appendix
(the `mnn.1` Appendix A / `8gk.6` Appendix A pattern). Pins conventions and
catches sign/limit errors that survive prose review.

### 5. Numerics policy, explicit and certified

State the saturation/overflow budget, the clamp thresholds, and the bf16
policy (which products run in fp32 islands under autocast — the same class as
tropical-LSE and the Lorentz-Minkowski products). Each policy gets a certify
assertion (constraint residual, round-trip, etc.). A mechanism that "lives or
dies on numerics" (hyperbolic, tropical) puts this section first.

### 6. A first-class interpretability observable into the metrics stream

The mechanism's learned-structure readout (tropical route coverage, hyperbolic
per-head curvature, Clifford per-grade norms, braid conserved charges) streams
to `metrics.jsonl` and into the run `summary.json` `results` block, so it is
*adjudicable from the train artifact alone* (registry predictions can target
`train:results.<observable>`). Not an afterthought — it is often the cleanest
falsifiable claim the mechanism has.

### 7. Goldens recapture in the SAME commit as any GPTConfig field

Adding a `GPTConfig` field trips the attention-goldens config-drift guard.
Recapture with `MGR_CAPTURE_ATTENTION_GOLDENS=1`, then **verify the diff is
config-only** (one inserted line per fixture, zero trajectory change) in the
same commit. The `eval_weight_quant_bits` field broke the gate for a day
unnoticed (fixed in fdxb) — this line is the lesson.

### 8. Standard invariant checks

Causality (no future-token gradient — every mechanism already has
`causality_no_future_grad`), plus the mechanism's algebra/conservation laws
(norm preservation for rotor mechanisms, Lipschitz bounds for tropical, mass
conservation for simplicial, charge conservation for braid). These are the
existing certify family; a new mechanism adds its own.

### 9. Off-floor campaign with pre-registered rung & stopping rule

The mechanism's headline comparison follows `campaign_preregistration_template.md`:
Phase-0 rung-finding, sample-efficiency vs asymptotic split, power-derived
seeds, one pre-registered stopping rule, quarantined probes, single `-H`
adjudication. **A floored win is not a structural win** (braid–Dyck).

## Audit: where the existing mechanisms stand (2026-06-13)

Honest snapshot from `mgr certify` (run `fdxb-cert-refresh-all`, 50/50 pass)
and the registry. ✓ present · ✗ gap · — N/A.

**The reduction-test column is empty across the board** — no existing
mechanism certifies an exact reduction/special-case, even where one is known
(tropical β-endpoints and ultrametric hard-digit==trie live in
`tests/test_algebraic_properties.py` / the 33dd trie path, not in `mgr
certify`). The coordinate-check column is empty because `lab.1` is open. These
are the gaps; concrete promotion beads are filed (see the beads linked from
`research_loop.md`). New mechanisms enter the gate green by construction;
existing mechanisms get retrofitted where a reduction is known and cheap —
highest value first: **octonion ⊃ quaternion subalgebra**, **tropical
β-endpoints (promote tests → certify)**, **ultrametric hard-digit == trie
(promote → certify)**, **gauge → standard at zero field**.
