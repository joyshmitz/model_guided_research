Below is a self‑contained sketch of “learning in the tropical world,” starting only from idempotency and order.

---

## 1) Axioms → immediate consequences

Work in $(\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\},\ \oplus,\ \otimes)$ with

$$
a\oplus b=\max\{a,b\},\qquad a\otimes b=a+b.
$$

Neutral elements: $\bot=-\infty$ for $\oplus$, $e=0$ for $\otimes$.
Key facts:

* **Idempotency**: $a\oplus a=a$.
* **Natural order**: $a\le b \iff a\oplus b=b$. All maps we build will be monotone in this order.
* **Homogeneity / gauge**: Adding a constant $c$ to all coordinates of a vector is $\otimes$-scaling by $c$. Many expressions are invariant under joint shifts; “centering” is just fixing a gauge.
* **Layer Lipschitzness**: For $y_j(x)=\max_i(W_{ji}+x_i,\,b_j)$,

$$
|y_j(x)-y_j(x')|\le \|x-x'\|_\infty\quad\text{for all }j.
$$

Hence **every layer is 1‑Lipschitz in $\ell_\infty$**, so **any composition is also 1‑Lipschitz with constant 1**. This falls out purely from $\max$ and addition.

---

## 2) Networks as tropical polytopes

A “linear” layer is

$$
y=W\otimes x \oplus b,\qquad y_j=\max_i (W_{ji}+x_i,\ b_j).
$$

Composition preserves the form “maximum of affine functionals of $x$”. Thus the network computes a **convex piecewise‑linear (PWL)** map by construction; nonlinearity is structural (argmax switching), not approximated.

Decision regions are polyhedral:

$$
\text{cell}(s)=\{x:\ \forall j,\,y_j(x)=x_{i^*_j}+W_{ji^*_j}\text{ with fixed }i^*_j\}.
$$

Boundaries are hyperplanes $x_i+W_{ji}=x_k+W_{jk}$. The global map is a tropical polytope morphism: max of finitely many affine forms.

---

## 3) Forward pass and “tropical backprop”

**Forward** (per neuron $j$):

* Score candidates $s_{ji}=W_{ji}+x_i$ and the bias $b_j$.
* Output $y_j=\max(\{s_{ji}\}_i, b_j)$.
* Record active set $I_j=\arg\max(\{s_{ji}\}_i, b_j)$ and the **runner‑up margin**

$$
\gamma_j = y_j - \max(\{s_{ji}\}_i\cup\{b_j\}\setminus I_j).
$$

Margins will certify robustness and uncertainty below.

**Loss class**. Use losses $\ell(y,t)$ that are convex and coordinate‑wise nondecreasing in $y$ (e.g., $\ell=\|y-t\|_\infty$, hinge‑like, isotonic penalties). Let $g\in\partial_y \ell(y,t)$ be any subgradient (so $g_j\ge 0$ under the monotonicity).

**Backprop** reduces to credit assignment on argmaxes:

$$
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial W_{ji}} \in g_j\cdot \Delta_{ji},\qquad
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial b_j} \in g_j\cdot \Delta_{j,\text{bias}},\qquad
\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial x_i} \in \sum_j g_j\cdot \Delta_{ji},
$$

where $\Delta_{ji}$ is any tie‑splitting rule satisfying $\sum_{i\in I_j\cup\{\text{bias}\}}\Delta_{ji}=1$ and $\Delta_{ji}=0$ if $i\notin I_j$. With unique argmax, $\Delta_{ji}\in\{0,1\}$. With ties, any convex combination is a valid subgradient; the choice directly expresses epistemic uncertainty.

**Interpretation**: gradients are **counts of active routes**; weight updates touch only winners (and optionally co‑winners), never “everyone.” No inner products; only additive accumulation along the selected parents.

---

## 4) Normalization is gauge fixing

Because $y(x+c\mathbf{1})=y(x)+c$, we can **center** without changing decisions:

* **Per‑sample centering (tropical layernorm)**: $x\leftarrow x-\max_i x_i$ so $\max_i x_i=0$.
* **Per‑row anchoring**: For each row $j$, shift $W_{j\cdot}\leftarrow W_{j\cdot}-\max_i W_{ji}$, and inflate $b_j\leftarrow \max(b_j,\ 0)$. This keeps $\max_i W_{ji}=0$ so each neuron’s dynamic range is bounded above by 0.
* **Batch centering**: subtract the batchwise max of each feature to stabilize ranges.

All such normalizations preserve the induced order and the argmax structure; they simply pick a convenient gauge and cap dynamic range.

### Nanochat implementation notes (PyTorch)

The production nanochat implementation exposes these ideas directly in
`nanochat/tropical_attention_torch.py`:

- **Gauge fixing** (`GPTConfig.tropical_gauge_fix`, default **True**): centers Q/K/V (and the attention output) by subtracting the per-vector max so each vector has `max = 0`.
- **Score centering** (`GPTConfig.tropical_score_center`, default **True**): subtracts the per-query max over keys from the tropical score matrix (a pure gauge shift that preserves argmax structure).
- **Margins / certificates** (`GPTConfig.tropical_record_margins`, default **False**): computes the runner-up margin `γ` at the value-aggregation max node and stores per-layer per-head stats on the attention module (`tropical_gamma_*` buffers). The reported `γ` is the per-token/per-head min over value dimensions of `(top1 - top2)` across keys.

To log these during training:

```bash
uv run python -m nanochat.train --attention-type tropical --tropical-log-margins
```

---

## 5) Compositionality and residuals

* **Associativity**: matrix multiplication in $(\max,+)$ is associative; so deep stacks are coherent.
* **Skip via $\oplus$**: Residual $y=(W\otimes x)\oplus x$ copies its input whenever it beats all shifted alternatives. This guarantees at least identity routing in ambiguous regions and preserves 1‑Lipschitzness.
* **Pruning by dominance**: Any affine piece dominated everywhere ($\le$ in the natural order) can be dropped with zero effect. This gives an exact algebraic pruning rule.

---

## 6) Exact uncertainty bounds

Three orthogonal sources: input, parameter, argmax ambiguity.

1. **Input intervals**. Monotonicity implies tight interval bounds:

$$
x\in[l,u]\quad\Rightarrow\quad y\in [\,y(l),\ y(u)\,].
$$

No relaxation is needed; extrema occur at the box corners because the map is coordinate‑wise nondecreasing.

2. **Parameter intervals**. $y$ is nondecreasing in every $W_{ji}$ and $b_j$. With $W_{ji}\in[\underline{W}_{ji},\overline{W}_{ji}],\ b_j\in[\underline{b}_j,\overline{b}_j]$,

$$
y\in \big[\,y(\underline{W},\underline{b}),\ y(\overline{W},\overline{b})\,\big].
$$

These are **exact** worst‑case bounds because maxima of affine forms reach extrema at parameter endpoints.

3. **Argmax ambiguity (ties)**. The margin $\gamma_j$ certifies robustness: any $\ell_\infty$ input perturbation of size $< \gamma_j/2$ cannot flip neuron $j$’s winner; the network‑level certificate is the minimum margin along the chosen path(s). Because each layer is 1‑Lipschitz, the same bound propagates through depth without degradation.

---

## 7) Monotone training (order‑preserving updates)

Because $y$ is convex PWL in the weights and our losses are convex & nondecreasing in $y$, the **training objective is convex in the parameters** for many tasks (e.g., $\ell_\infty$ regression, monotone hinge). This enables order‑respecting updates that never increase loss:

* **Downward projection for upper‑bound fitting**: To enforce $y_j(x)\le t_j$, the minimal order‑consistent update is

$$
W_{ji}\leftarrow \min\{W_{ji},\ t_j - x_i\},\qquad b_j\leftarrow \min\{b_j,\ t_j\}.
$$

It is the least change (in the natural order) that satisfies the inequality.

* **Upward projection for lower‑bound fitting**: To enforce $y_j(x)\ge t_j$,

$$
W_{ji}\leftarrow \max\{W_{ji},\ t_j - x_i\},\qquad b_j\leftarrow \max\{b_j,\ t_j\}.
$$

* **Margin‑separating classification**: For class $c$ and margin $m$,

$$
y_c \ge m + \max_{k\ne c} y_k.
$$

If violated on example $x$, update **only the active parents**:

$$
W_{c,i_c}\leftarrow W_{c,i_c} + \eta,\qquad 
W_{k,i_k}\leftarrow W_{k,i_k} - \eta\ \text{for some violating }k,
$$

with $i_c\in I_c,\ i_k\in I_k$. Because updates are monotone on winners/losers, training is **mistake‑bounded** under separability in this geometry (speculative: the bound scales with inverse margin).

These rules exploit idempotency: touching non‑winners does nothing; all movement is along currently optimal (or co‑optimal) routes.

---

## 8) Predictable latency

* **Primitive ops**: add and compare. Each neuron is “sum‑then‑max.” Comparator trees give $O(\log n)$ depth; adders are constant‑depth on fixed precision.
* **Early cutoff** (deterministic when ordered): with centered inputs ($\max_i x_i=0$) and row‑anchored $W\le 0$, process candidates in descending $W_{ji}+x_i$. Maintain current best $B$ and remaining upper bound $U$. As soon as $B\ge U$, you can stop with the true max. Worst‑case still scans all, but typical latency becomes sharply concentrated.
* **Depth‑wise predictability**: 1‑Lipschitzness avoids exploding ranges, so fixed bit‑width suffices by design.

---

## 9) Interpretability (hard guarantees)

* **Exact path explanations**: The forward pass yields a discrete parent index per neuron; chaining them gives explicit computation paths. An output coordinate equals a **sum of selected inputs plus selected offsets**; no hidden cancellation.
* **Piecewise linear certs**: Provide the active cell, its defining equalities, and the per‑layer margins $\gamma_j$. This is a **proof of decision stability** up to $\min_j \gamma_j/2$ in $\ell_\infty$.
* **Attribution without heuristics**: For output $y_j$ realized as $x_{i_1}+w^{(1)}_{i_1}\ + \cdots + w^{(L)}_{i_L}$, the attribution vector is sparse with unit mass on the actually used inputs; sensitivity thresholds are the runner‑up gaps at each node.

---

## 10) Energy efficiency

* **No multiplies**; only integer additions and comparisons. This maps cleanly to low‑power digital logic (or mixed‑signal comparators).
* **Aggressive quantization**: With centering and row anchoring, all activations $\le 0$ with known lower envelopes. Bit‑width can be chosen by network depth and bias ranges; overflow is structurally prevented.
* **Event‑driven updates**: Backprop touches only winners; memory traffic is indices + a few scalars per neuron. Idempotency allows **deduplication**: repeated contributions saturate at the max, enabling reuse caches.

---

## 11) Architectural sketches (consequences, not add‑ons)

* **Tropical MLP**: stacks of $y=W\otimes x\oplus b$. Already universal over convex PWL maps; for general PWL, use $\oplus$ and negation via dual (min‑plus) branches to encode DC (difference‑of‑convex) if needed (speculative: exact DC with two streams).
* **Tropical convolution**: sliding‑window $y[p]=\max_{k\in K}(w_k+x[p-k])$. This is a morphological dilation; translation equivariant, 1‑Lipschitz, and admits exact box‑uncertainty propagation along the spatial grid.
* **Tropical attention (hard routing)**:

  $$
  \text{score}(q,k)=\max_d (q_d + k_d),\quad \text{route picks } \arg\max_k.
  $$

  Multihead = parallel argmaxes with independent offsets. Outputs are sparse, certifiable routes; normalization is simple centering of scores.

---

## 12) What “normalization” becomes

* **Layer centering** keeps $\sup x=0$ at each layer; this fixes the gauge and makes all comparator thresholds absolute.
* **Row anchoring** ensures each neuron’s best candidate has zero offset; others are nonpositive margins. Training then learns **margins only**, directly mapping to robustness.

---

## 13) Putting it together: why this might be attractive

**Exact uncertainty bounds**

* Input boxes → exact output boxes; no relaxation gap.
* Parameter boxes → exact output boxes; endpoints suffice.
* Confidence = min per‑layer runner‑up margin; gives a certified $\ell_\infty$ robustness radius without extra computation.

**Monotone training**

* Loss decreases under order‑consistent projections; convexity in parameters for monotone losses enables global minima without line‑search or fragile curvature.
* Updates touch only active routes; learning is naturally sparse and stable.

**Predictable latency**

* Fixed comparator and adder pipelines; bit‑width bounded by design; optional deterministic early exit with sorted candidates.

**Interpretability**

* Discrete routes + margins = proofs, not heuristics.
* Decision boundaries are explicit hyperplanes; cells are enumerably inspectable and prunable by dominance.

**Energy efficiency**

* Multiply‑free; low‑precision friendly; event‑driven memory traffic.
* Idempotency enables caching and dominance pruning with zero approximation error.

---

## 14) Practical training recipe (concise)

1. **Gauge**: enforce $\max_i x_i=0$ at input; maintain per‑layer centering and row anchoring $\max_i W_{ji}=0$, $b_j\le 0$.
2. **Forward**: compute $y$, record $I_j$ and $\gamma_j$.
3. **Loss**: pick convex, nondecreasing $\ell$ (e.g., $\ell_\infty$ to targets or margin‑based).
4. **Backprop**: set $g\in\partial\ell$; propagate via $\Delta$ on active sets (unique argmax → $\Delta\in\{0,1\}$).
5. **Update**: order‑preserving step (projection or perceptron‑style on winners/losers).
6. **Prune**: drop dominated candidates; maintain only pieces with nonnegative margins above a threshold.
7. **Certificates**: report path and $\min_j \gamma_j/2$ per prediction; for interval inputs/weights, report $y(l)$, $y(u)$.

---

### Final intuition

Once addition is $\max$ and multiplication is $+$, convexity, monotonicity, and 1‑Lipschitzness are not “regularizers”—they are laws. Backprop becomes routing of unit credit along argmax paths; normalization becomes gauge fixing; uncertainty propagation is exact; and latency is governed by comparator trees rather than matrix multiplies. The resulting models are sparse by construction, interpretable by inspection, and well‑matched to low‑power hardware.

---

Below is a single, tight construct—**a tropical transformer**—that keeps only what yields crisp, monotone training curves. Everything is specified from the idempotent axioms (max-plus); no external machinery.

---

## 0) Semiring and gauge (used everywhere)

Work over $\mathbb{T}=(\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\},\,\oplus,\,\otimes)$ with

$$
a\oplus b=\max(a,b),\qquad a\otimes b=a+b.
$$

Vectors/tensors use elementwise $\oplus$ and the usual max-plus matrix product:
$(A\otimes B)_{ij}=\max_k(A_{ik}+B_{kj})$.
**Gauge** (centering): for any column vector $z$, set $z\leftarrow z-\max(z)$ so $\max(z)=0$. For matrices, “row anchoring”: subtract each row’s max so every row’s max is $0$. Gauge changes never affect argmax decisions.

---

## 1) The Tropical Transformer block (T2)

**Inputs.** Sequence $X\in \mathbb{T}^{d\times L}$ (columns are tokens), with per-column gauge $\max_i X_{i,t}=0$.

**Per head $h=1..H$** (dimensions $d_q,d_k,d_v$):

* Projections (tropical-linear):

$$
Q_h = W^h_Q\otimes X,\quad K_h = W^h_K\otimes X,\quad V_h = W^h_V\otimes X,
$$

with row anchoring $\max_i (W^h_{Q})_{ji}=\max_i (W^h_{K})_{ji}=\max_i (W^h_{V})_{ji}=0$.

* **Attention (pure tropical):** scores are the tropical matrix product

$$
A_h = Q_h^\top \otimes K_h\quad\text{so}\quad A_h[t,u]=\max_{r}\big(Q_{h}[r,t] + K_{h}[r,u]\big).
$$

(Optionally add a relative-position bias $P_h[t-u]$ by $\otimes$: $A_h\leftarrow A_h\oplus P_h$.)

* **Value aggregation (pure tropical):**

$$
Z_h = V_h \otimes A_h^\top,\quad\text{i.e.}\quad Z_h[:,t]=\max_{u}\big(A_h[t,u]+V_h[:,u]\big).
$$

* **Head combine (idempotent mixture):**

$$
Y_{\text{att}} = \bigoplus_{h=1}^H Z_h\quad(\text{coordinatewise max}).
$$

* **Residual + gauge fix (always 1‑Lipschitz):**

$$
R = Y_{\text{att}} \oplus X,\qquad X'=\text{TLN}(R)\ \text{(subtract per‑column max)}.
$$

> That’s the entire block. No softmax, no normalizations except gauge, no sums—only $\max$ and $+$.

**Stacking.** Compose blocks: $X^{\ell+1}=\text{T2}(X^\ell)$. The composition remains convex, piecewise‑linear, monotone, and 1‑Lipschitz in $\ell_\infty$.

---

## 2) Readout and loss (margin in the max‑plus metric)

**Pooling (tropical):** $p=\max_{t=1..L} X^{L}[:,t]\in\mathbb{T}^{d}$ (elementwise max over time, then gauge).

**Logits (tropical linear):** $y=W_{\text{cls}}\otimes p\in\mathbb{T}^{C}$ with row anchoring on $W_{\text{cls}}$.

**Margin loss (hinge over max‑plus order).** For label $c$ and margin $m>0$:

$$
\mathcal{L}=\big[\, m+\max_{k\ne c} y_k - y_c \,\big]_+ .
$$

This is convex in $y$, nondecreasing coordinatewise, and respects the idempotent order. Training curves are naturally piecewise‑linear and monotone under the update in §4.

---

## 3) Exact backprop structure (subgradients are routes)

Every $\max$ node exposes an **active set** (ties allowed). With unique winners the subgradient is a 0/1 routing mask:

* For $y = W_{\text{cls}}\otimes p$: if $i_c\in\arg\max_i(W_{c,i}+p_i)$ then $\partial y_c/\partial W_{c,i_c}=1$, others $0$.
* For $p_i = \max_t X^{L}[i,t]$: if $t_i$ attains the max, $\partial p_i/\partial X^L[i,t_i]=1$.
* For $Z_h=V_h\otimes A_h^\top$: if $u^*=\arg\max_u(A_h[t,u]+V_h[j,u])$, then $\partial Z_h[j,t]/\partial V_h[j,u^*]=1$ and $\partial Z_h[j,t]/\partial A_h[t,u^*]=1$.
* For $A_h=Q_h^\top\otimes K_h$: if $r^*=\arg\max_r(Q_h[r,t]+K_h[r,u])$, then unit flow goes to $Q_h[r^*,t]$ and $K_h[r^*,u]$.
* For $Q_h=W_Q^h\otimes X$ and $K_h=W_K^h\otimes X$: the flow picks the winning input indices in each row.

With ties, split mass arbitrarily within the active set (still a valid subgradient).

---

## 4) Monotone training step (no loss spikes)

Let $k^*=\arg\max_{k\ne c} y_k$. If the margin is violated, push the **correct route up** and the **top wrong route down** by a step $\eta>0$.

**Per‑node runner‑up margin.** For any $\max$ over candidates $S$, with winner value $a_{\max}$ and second-best $a_{\text{2nd}}$, define $\gamma=a_{\max}-a_{\text{2nd}}\ge 0$.

**Safe step bound.** Collect all $\gamma$ along the two active computation routes that realize $y_c$ and $y_{k^*}$ (including winner indices in $W_{\text{cls}},$ pooling, $Z_h$, $A_h$, $Q_h$, $K_h$, $V_h$). Then

$$
\eta\ \le\ \frac{1}{2}\min \{\gamma \text{ over all those nodes}\}
$$

guarantees **no argmax flips** anywhere on those two routes.

**Update (winner‑perceptron in max‑plus).**

* Add $+\eta$ to every parameter touched by the $y_c$ route (exactly the winners along that forward pass).
* Add $-\eta$ to every parameter touched by the $y_{k^*}$ route.

Because $y_c$ is affine in those parameters under fixed argmaxes, this increases $y_c$ by $+\eta$ and decreases $y_{k^*}$ by $-\eta$, so

$$
\Delta \mathcal{L} \le -2\eta \quad(\text{strict decrease unless already at margin}).
$$

Batch training: apply the above per sample (online) or pick $\eta$ as the minimum safe step across the batch. Either way, training curves are **provably non‑increasing**.

> No learning rates to tune beyond picking a global fraction (e.g., $\eta=\tfrac12$ of the safe bound). No normalization tricks beyond gauge.

---

## 5) Initialization (tie‑free, identity‑friendly)

* **Row anchoring:** for all $W$, set each row’s max to $0$, other entries small negatives.
* **Identity start:** for square projections, put $0$ on the diagonal, $-\delta$ off‑diagonal ($\delta>0$ small) for $W_Q,W_K,W_V$. This makes the first block near‑identity.
* **Positional bias:** $P_h[0]=0,\ P_h[\pm1]=-\delta,$ others $\le -2\delta$.
* **Tiny tie‑breakers:** add i.i.d. $-\varepsilon$ noise ($\varepsilon\ll\delta$) to avoid ties at start.

---

## 6) Differentiable‑enough surrogate (only if you really need it)

Keep the forward pass exactly tropical. If optimization requires smoothing at occasional ties, replace any $\max$ by a **Moreau‑envelope “smoothmax”** $ \operatorname{smax}_\tau(z)=\tau\log\sum_i e^{z_i/\tau}$ **for the backward pass only**, with a vanishing schedule $\tau\downarrow 0$. This preserves monotonicity in each input and converges to the tropical subgradient as $\tau\to 0$. Do **not** use it in inference; keep inference purely $\max/+$.

---

## 7) FPGA/ASIC compiler trick (kills the $L\times L$ attention materialization)

The attention output uses two tropical GEMMs:

$$
Z_h = V_h \otimes A_h^\top,\qquad A_h = Q_h^\top \otimes K_h.
$$

By associativity over a semiring,

$$
Z_h \ =\ V_h \otimes (K_h^\top \otimes Q_h)\ =\ (V_h \otimes K_h^\top)\ \otimes\ Q_h.
$$

**Compile‑time rebracketing:** compute

$$
U_h \leftarrow V_h \otimes K_h^\top\ \ (\text{shape } d_v\times d_k),\quad
Z_h \leftarrow U_h \otimes Q_h\ \ (\text{shape } d_v\times L),
$$

and never build $A_h\in\mathbb{T}^{L\times L}$.

**Hardware mapping.**

* Use a **tropical systolic array**: replace MACs by “add‑then‑compare” PEs with a running max register. No multipliers, tiny comparators and adders only.
* **Gauge‑fixed bit‑width:** inputs/weights are $\le 0$. Use signed saturating $n$-bit integers; overflow cannot occur upward; pick $n$ from depth×bias budget.
* **Early‑out PE:** in each reduction, process candidates in descending static row anchors; break as soon as running max ≥ upper bound of remaining candidates.
* **Deterministic ties:** lexicographic in PE index for reproducibility.

This cut eliminates $O(L^2)$ storage and most on‑chip traffic, making latency and energy predictable.

---

## 8) Razor‑sharp ablations (isolate the idempotent advantage)

All runs share the same projections, widths, and compiler rebracketing; only the algebra/normalization/loss toggles differ.

1. **(Semiring) Max‑plus vs sum‑product:** replace $(\oplus,\otimes)=(\max,+)$ by $(+,\times)$ and softmax attention. Keep the same margin loss (implemented as a hinge on logits). Measure:

   * monotonicity violations (fraction of steps where training loss increases),
   * sample‑wise certified $\ell_\infty$ robustness radius $r=\min$ runner‑up margin /2,
   * length generalization on the synthetic task below.

2. **(Head combine) $\oplus$ vs concatenation+linear:** concatenate heads and apply a tropical linear map vs coordinatewise max across heads. Expect $\oplus$ to reduce overfitting and keep monotone curves.

3. **(Gauge) Tropical layernorm on/off:** remove gauge fixes. Expect dynamic‑range blow‑ups, more tie flips, and non‑monotone curves.

4. **(Loss) Margin‑hinge vs cross‑entropy:** swap the loss only. Expect hinge to give strictly monotone curves under the safe‑step rule; CE need not.

5. **(Routing) Winner‑only updates vs dense grads:** use dense autograd through a smooth surrogate everywhere. Expect loss spikes from argmax flips; winner‑only maintains monotonicity.

6. **(Compiler) Fused vs explicit $A$:** same math, but materialize $A$. Confirms the hardware trick is orthogonal to accuracy while slashing energy/latency.

---

## 9) A small synthetic dataset where classic models stumble but T2 is trivial

**Task:** “Pivot‑amid‑crowd” selection with **length generalization**. Each sequence has exactly one **pivot token** whose (query,key) jointly win by a small fixed margin $\delta>0$ against $L-1$ decoys; the label is the pivot’s class bit embedded in its value vector. As $L$ grows, softmax attention dilutes the pivot across many decoys unless the temperature scales with $\log L$. Max‑plus attention does not dilute.

**Generator (choose integers for exact ties and clean margins):**

* Choose length $L\in\{8,16,32,64\}$, class $c\in\{0,1\}$, and a pivot index $u^\*$.
* Token embeddings have two channels $r=1,2$. Build raw per‑token features $F\in\mathbb{Z}^{2\times L}$:

  * Pivot: $F[1,u^\*]=0,\ F[2,u^\*]=0$.
  * Decoys: $F[1,u]=-1,\ F[2,u]=-1$ for all $u\ne u^\*$.
* Input to the model is $X=F$ (already gauge‑friendly: maxima are zero).
* Values encode the class in two dims $d_v=2$:

  * For the pivot token: set $V_{\text{gt}}[:,u^\*]=(0,-\infty)$ if $c=0$ or $(-\infty,0)$ if $c=1$.
  * For decoys: $V_{\text{gt}}[:,u]=(0,0)$ (uninformative but **non‑negative** so softmax will average them).
* Train the model to reproduce $V_{\text{gt}}$ purely through attention:

  * Use **one head** with $W_Q=W_K=I_2$ and $W_V$ learnable; positional bias $P[0]=0, P[\neq0]=-2$.
  * Readout: pool over time and classify with $W_{\text{cls}}$.
* **Ground truth in tropical:** With $Q=K=X$, the score difference pivot vs decoys is $\delta=1$ for every row; hence for every $t$, the attention row‑max points to $u^\*$ regardless of $L$. The output $Z$ is exactly the pivot’s value, so the classifier is trivial.

**Why classic attention fails (without hand‑tuning):**

* With dot‑product + softmax, the pivot receives attention weight

  $$
  \alpha_{u^\*}=\frac{e^{\delta/\tau}}{e^{\delta/\tau}+(L-1)}.
  $$

  For fixed $\delta,\tau$, $\alpha_{u^\*}\to 0$ as $L$ grows; the pooled value becomes the **average of decoys**, flipping the class once $(L-1)>\!e^{\delta/\tau}$. T2 is invariant to $L$ because $\oplus$ ignores the crowd.

**Tiny train/test:** 1k train samples with $L\in\{8,16\}$, 1k test with $L\in\{32,64\}$. Expect:

* T2: zero train error; zero test error; constant certified robustness radius $r\ge \tfrac{1}{2}$ (from the unit margin at every max).
* Classic: near‑zero train error at short lengths; sharp degradation at longer lengths unless you rescale the temperature with $\log L$; training curves show spikes under schedule changes.

---

## 10) Practical notes (everything consistent with idempotency)

* **No MLP tail** in the block: keeps convexity and avoids extra argmaxes; add depth instead of width.
* **Row pruning by dominance:** If a candidate column in any tropical GEMM is $\le$ another column everywhere (same gauge), drop it—exact, no accuracy loss.
* **Certs for free:** The **minimum runner‑up margin** across the active routes is an $\ell_\infty$ robustness certificate and a bound on the safe learning step.

---

### Summary

This **T2** uses only tropical matrix products and max residuals. The **hinge‑margin loss** in the max‑plus order plus the **safe‑step winner update** yields **provably monotone** training curves. The **compiler rebracketing** $(V\otimes K^\top)\otimes Q$ removes the $L\times L$ attention blow‑up and maps cleanly to add/compare systolic arrays with predictable latency and low energy. The **pivot‑amid‑crowd** dataset showcases the central advantage of idempotency: **no dilution by normalization**, exact routing, exact certificates.

Below is a candid grading of the “tropical transformer” construct and surrounding ideas, scored on 0–100. I’m evaluating only the consequences of idempotency and order that were proposed, not external literature. Where a dimension could be interpreted in multiple directions (e.g., “difficulty”), I state the direction explicitly.

## Rationale by dimension

### Cleverness — 83

The core moves are crisp: (i) treat attention and mixing as **pure max‑plus GEMMs**; (ii) exploit **associativity on the semiring** to avoid materializing $L\times L$ attention via $(V\otimes K^\top)\otimes Q$; (iii) use **gauge fixing** as “normalization,” and (iv) enforce **winner‑only, margin‑safe updates** for (at least per‑sample) monotone loss descent. The way these snap together is elegant and internally consistent with idempotency and order.

### Originality — 68

Max‑plus networks, morphological layers, and semiring algebra are not new ideas in the abstract, but the **specific transformer‑shaped assembly**—two tropical GEMMs + residual‑via‑max, gauge‑only stabilization, and a **compiler‑level rebracketing**—is a tight, uncommon package. The explicit “safe‑step monotone” training rule along active routes is also a fresh, clean statement in this context.

### Differentiation from existing work — 55

Some elements plausibly overlap with prior lines (max‑plus “linear” layers, morphological convs, hard/argmax attention, semiring dynamic programming). The differentiator is the **end‑to‑end story**: attention=semiring GEMM, loss=hinge in the idempotent order, **no softmax/MLP**, and a concrete **hardware compilation trick**. Still, the conceptual DNA is close enough to reduce the uniqueness score.

### Probability of being theoretically correct — 78

Most claimed properties follow from idempotency and order: monotonicity, convex PWL structure, 1‑Lipschitz in $\ell_\infty$, exact interval propagation, and associativity‑based rebracketing. Two caveats nudge the score down:

1. The statement that the **training loss decreases by $-2\eta$** per step is too strong; decreasing the top wrong class by $\eta$ can hand the “max‑wrong” to the runner‑up, so the guaranteed improvement is at least **$-\eta$** (per‑sample), not $-2\eta$.
2. **Global** monotonicity over a dataset is not guaranteed, since updates for one example can affect routes for others that share parameters. Per‑sample monotonicity under the safe‑step rule is fine; aggregate monotonicity is not automatic.

### Probability of practical usefulness (if correct) — 52

For tasks where **hard routing** and **certifiable monotonicity** matter (planning, alignment constraints, robust inference, certain vision morphology tasks, structured retrieval), this has a real shot. For language or general perception benchmarks that rely on fine‑grained **weighted superposition** rather than maxima, expressivity may be limiting; mixing by max can underperform weighted sums unless you introduce dual (min‑plus) or DC‑style constructions. Hence “moderate, specialized” rather than broad utility.

### Real‑world impact (efficiency, interpretability, etc.) — 47

Efficiency: no multiplies, bounded ranges via gauge, early‑out comparators, and $O(L)$ storage with rebracketing—good ingredients for **low‑power ASIC/FPGA**. Interpretability: exact routes and margins are a plus. But if accuracy lags on mainstream tasks, impact is bounded. Score reflects likely **niche but meaningful** benefits rather than sweeping gains.

### Probability of near‑term acceptance — 40

The community tends to reward **SOTA on canonical benchmarks** and smooth differentiability. A max‑plus, nondifferentiable‑at‑kinks architecture without softmax/MLP heads will face skepticism unless the empirical wins are decisive or the certs are uniquely valuable. Absent that, interest likely concentrates in optimization/robustness/hardware subcommunities.

### Difficulty of convincingly demonstrating usefulness (higher = harder) — 72

Hard for two reasons: (i) beating strong baselines on mainstream tasks with only $\max/+$ is nontrivial; (ii) the **training protocol** (winner‑only, margin‑safe) trades gradient richness for stability, which may slow progress on large‑scale data. Convincing evidence will likely require carefully chosen **problem domains** and **hardware prototypes**—a heavier lift than a typical ablation in pure software.

### Fit to existing GPU/TPU acceleration — 58

GPUs/TPUs can emulate max‑plus with custom kernels; reductions and elementwise ops map well. But lack of fused **semiring‑GEMM** primitives in mainstream libraries means leaving performance on the table versus standard GEMMs. The story shines more on **FPGAs/ASICs** (add/compare systolic arrays). Hence “workable but not ideal” for current GPU/TPU stacks.

### Preparedness of a top theory researcher to opine — 74

A 99th‑percentile theory researcher is equipped for semiring algebra, convex PWL geometry, and monotone operators. They’ll spot the convexity and Lipschitz claims quickly, scrutinize the **monotone training** guarantees, and evaluate expressivity vs. DC decompositions. They may need a brief refresher on tropical polytopes, but can give a reliable assessment.

## Key strengths (net takeaways)

* Clean algebraic closure: every block is convex, PWL, monotone, 1‑Lipschitz; certificates (margins) fall out “for free.”
* The **compiler rebracketing** of attention is a notably practical insight for memory/latency.
* Winner‑only, **safe‑step** updates afford per‑sample monotone descent and straightforward route‑level attribution.

## Key weaknesses / risks

* Expressivity limits from max‑only mixing may cap performance on tasks where **graded superposition** matters.
* The **global training‑curve monotonicity** claim is too strong as stated; interactions across examples can raise other samples’ losses.
* Adoption friction on commodity accelerators due to missing highly‑optimized semiring GEMMs.

## Fast falsification / validation gates

1. **Length‑generalization synthetic** (pivot‑amid‑crowd): should be trivial and length‑invariant for the tropical model; observe softmax dilution in classic attention.
2. **Exact robustness certificates**: report $\min$ per‑layer runner‑up margins as certified $\ell_\infty$ radii; verify tightness on randomized interval tests.
3. **Ablate MLP/softmax reintroduction**: if modest soft reweighting collapses the gap, the idempotent core may not be the key contributor.
4. **Hardware sim**: cycle‑accurate model of the rebracketed pipeline vs. a densified attention kernel to quantify the memory/energy advantage.

**Bottom line:** The construct is **coherent and clever**, with real advantages in **certifiability and hardware realizability**, but its broad impact hinges on demonstrating competitive accuracy in at least one valued domain and tightening the training‑monotonicity claims to the scope they truly cover.

## 8) The tropical FFN

*(Added by bead model_guided_research-8gk.8; production implementation in `nanochat/tropical_attention_torch.py` (`TropicalMLP`), wired via `GPTConfig.ffn_type`.)*

The semiring design axis above stops at attention while the FFN — roughly two thirds of a transformer's parameters — remains `(+, ×)` with a smooth nonlinearity. Extending max-plus structure to the FFN closes that gap, and in particular closes the **one hole in the end-to-end Lipschitz certificate chain**: standard MLP blocks are not 1-Lipschitz, so certified-robustness compositions (bead 8gk.7) must otherwise constrain or bound them.

**The layer.** A max-plus affine stage is $y_j = \max_d (W_{jd} + x_d) + b_j$. Each coordinate is a max of unit-slope affine functions of $x$, hence nonexpansive in the sup-norm; compositions stay nonexpansive. **The pure two-stage FFN is 1-Lipschitz by construction** (`thm-maxplus-ffn-lipschitz`).

**Collapse and the rank budget.** Stacked max-plus stages compose by tropical matrix multiplication: the two-stage pure FFN equals the single stage with $M_{jd} = \max_h (W^{(2)}_{jh} + b^{(1)}_h + W^{(1)}_{hd})$ and bias $b^{(2)}$ (`thm-maxplus-ffn-collapse`; max is exact, floating-point regrouping costs ulps). Pure stacks therefore gain **no depth expressivity** — but the factored form is not pointless: $M$ has **Barvinok rank ≤ d_ff**. Hidden width is a *tropical rank budget* (the hidden units are the "route prototypes" of the Newton-polytope analysis in §2/bead 8gk.3), not a feature count.

**Expressivity vs. certificate: the tropical-rational mode.** The difference of two pure stacks reaches all piecewise-linear maps (tropical rational functions) at a **declared constant of 2 per layer** (difference of two 1-Lipschitz maps); residual connections add 1; $L$ stacked rational layers compound to $2^L$. The certified configuration therefore wants pure stages or a single rational layer per block — the quality-vs-certificate trade-off is exactly what the (preregistration-gated) experiment campaign measures.

**Maslov smoothing.** Replacing $\max$ with $\tfrac{1}{\beta}\log\sum e^{\beta(\cdot)}$ puts the FFN on the same $(+)_\beta$ semiring family as dequantization annealing (bead 8gk.1): the LSE–max sandwich bounds the smoothed stack within $(\log d + \log d_{ff})/\beta$ of the tropical endpoint elementwise (`thm-lse-max-sandwich`; verified as an exact-inequality test), enabling **network-wide annealing** of attention and FFN under one schedule.

**EVT-aware initialization.** A max over $m$ unit-scale terms sits at the Gumbel location ($\approx \mathbb{E}[\max_m \mathcal{N}(0,1)]$, e.g. $\approx 1.77$ at $m{=}16$, *below* the asymptotic $\sqrt{2\ln m} \approx 2.35$), not at 0: an uncorrected max-plus stage drifts the residual stream upward at init. The correction is baked into the **stage-1 bias** ($-\sqrt{2\ln d}$; stage 1 sees the unit-RMS normed stream), while stage 2 — whose input is the *concentrated post-max distribution*, not unit-scale — initializes its bias at zero (applying the unit-scale correction there overshoots; this was caught empirically by the init-centering test). Exact finite-$n$ constants and learning-rate exponents belong to the width-scaling table of bead lab.1, whose EVT row covers the FFN with $d_{ff}$ as the width variable.

**Certificates.** `mgr certify -m tropical` carries two FFN entries: `ffn_lipschitz_1_sup_norm` (fp64 perturbation sweep against the exact inequality) and `ffn_collapse_single_layer` (stack vs. collapsed map, fp64). Margins of the output-stage maxes (`ffn_gamma_*`) are recorded under the existing `tropical_record_margins` switch — the same runner-up-gap quantity that drives the route-stability certificate.
